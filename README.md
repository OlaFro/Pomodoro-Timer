# Pomodoro-Timer

Project finishing browser module of DCI web-developer course.

The clock counts down 25 minutes. This is called a **session**, a time for a user to focus on tasks.
After this time clock starts to count down time for the **short break** - 3 minutes. Then session starts again.
After fourth session comes a **longer break** that takes 20 minutes.

Pomodoro clock follows this pattern:

- Session

* Break

- Session

* Break

- Session

* Break

- Session
